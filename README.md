The SVD is one of the top, versatile, and most widely used computational methods of numerical linear algebra.The practical applications of SVD are far reaching. It can be used, for instance, for dimension reduction (matrix low-rank approximation, model-order reduction,
etc.), for the identification of principal components, for image compression.

When working with image datasets, say, for machine learning applications, it may be neces-
sary to reduce image size and to reduce redundant information from images.This exercise
is concerned with image compression using SVD. Note that, the SVD can be used as part of a
data preprocessing step or as a solution method on its own.
